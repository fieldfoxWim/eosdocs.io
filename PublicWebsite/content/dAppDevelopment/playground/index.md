#### Account creation

Creating account is covered in detail [here](../accounts). But in summary all this page is doing is:

* 1. Generating a key pair to be used for the owner. 
* 2. Generating a key pair to be used for the active.
* 3. Creating the account using the public keys from each of the above. 

```
$ ./cleos create key
Private key: AAAAAAAAAAAA
Public key: CCCCCCCCCC


$./cleos create key
Private key: CCCCCCCCC
Public key: DDDDDDDDDDDD

$./cleos -H {Server} -p {Port} create account eosio mynewaccount CCCCCCCCCC DDDDDDDDDDDD
```
